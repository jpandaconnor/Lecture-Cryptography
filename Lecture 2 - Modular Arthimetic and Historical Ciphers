1: Modular arithmetic

    Goal: Computation in Finite Sets

    Finite: "limited in size or extent: "
    Finite Sets: "In mathematics, a finite set is a set that has a finite number of elements"

    Example for a finite set in everyday life:
        For example, if I said meet in 20 hours we wouldn't 12+20 = 32 hours. We wouldn't meet at 32 hours, instead we would
        meet at 8 in the morning.

        The clock is finite (Limited in size)

        Finite sets can be defined as a circle for example. Like a clock

        Overall:
            - Going to the bakery is not finite - If you want 12 rolls and 20, we will get 32
            - If I am going to meet someone in 20 hours, we will end up meeting at 8 in the morning
                as a clock is infinite.

        Modular Operator
            - Basically how many times does it divide and give us the remainder

            Definition:
                (HERE COMES THE NOT SO NICE STUFF :CCCC)

                | = Devices
                Triple Equals = Equivalant to

                - Let A,R,M Element of Z AND m > 0 (M is positive)
                    Then we Write
                        - A -= r modM

                        IF m devides (m - r)
                            M | (a - r)

            
            Examples:

                (What is r?)

                a = 13, m = 9, r = ?

                Take 13 and divide. How often does the modulus divice into 13

                13 / 9 = 1
                    Modulus -= 4 mod 9

                a - r = 13
                13 - 4 = 9

                9 Is divisable by 9

    
    Computation of the remainder:

        - Given: a,m eZ
            a = BLANK m

            How often does a fit into m

            q = Quotiant!

            a = qm + r

            Example:

                a = 42
                m (modulus) = 9

                42 = BLANK  9

                42 = 49 + 6 += 6 (Equivalant to 6)


                BUT ALSO

                42 = 3 . 9 + 15 => += 15 - THE REMAINDER IS NOT UNIQUE

        Overall: The remainder is not unique

    Equivalence classes:

        - a = 12, m = 5

            12 = 2 mod 5

            OR
            
            12 -= 7 

            TO CHECK THIS IS EQUIV

                12 -= 7

                5 | (12 - 7)
                5 | 5

                    = 1

        12 -= -3

            CHECK 5|(12 - (-3)) =
                5 | 15

                    = 3

        DEFINE THE SET

            { -3, 2, 7} CREMENTS BY 5. Infinite Set

            This forms an equivalence class. module 5. All members (numbers) of the class behave 
                equivalent modulous 5
